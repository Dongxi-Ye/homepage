Abstract: One of the properties of the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction is its representation as an infinite product
given by
$$
\scriptr(q) = q^{1/5}\prod_{j=1}^\infty (1-q^j)^{\left(\frac{j}{5}\right)}
$$
where $\left(\frac{j}{p}\right)$ is the Legendre symbol. 
In this work we study the level $13$ function 
$$
R(q) = q\prod_{j=1}^\infty (1-q^j)^{\left(\frac{j}{13}\right)}
$$
and establish many properties analogous to those for the fifth power of the
Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction.
Many of the properties extend to other levels $\ell$ for which $\ell-1$ divides $24$, and a brief
account of these results is included.
