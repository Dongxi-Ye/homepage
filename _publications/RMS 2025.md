Abstract: We give Euler-like recursive formulas for the $t$-colored partition function when $$t=2$$ or $$t=3,$$ as well as for all $$t$$-regular partition functions. 
In particular, we derive an infinite family of ``triangular number" recurrences for the $3$-colored partition function. Our proofs are inspired by the 
recent work of Gomez, Ono, Saad, and Singh on the ordinary partition function and make extensive use of $$q$$-series identities for $$(q;q)_{\infty}$$ and $$(q;q)_{\infty}^3.$$
