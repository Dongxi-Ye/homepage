Abstract: In this note, we revisit Ramanujan type series for $$\frac{1}{\pi}$$ and show how they arise from genus zero subgroups of $${SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$$ that are commensurable with $${SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$$. As illustrations, we reproduce a striking formula of Ramanujan for $$\frac{1}{\pi}$$ and a recent result of Cooper et al., as well as derive a new rational Ramanujan type series for $$\frac{1}{\pi}$$. As a byproduct, we obtain a Clausen type formula in some general sense and reproduce a Clausen type quadratic transformation formula closely related to the aforementioned formula of Ramanujan.
