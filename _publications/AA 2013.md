Abstract: Hurwitz determined the number of ways a square can be expressed as a sum of five squares.
In this work, we determine the number of solutions, in integers of each of the equations
$x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}+x_{4}^{2}+2x_{5}^{2}=n^{2}$,
$x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}+x_{4}^{2}+3x_{5}^{2}=n^{2}$ and
$x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}+2x_{4}^{2}+3x_{5}^{2}=n^{2}$ for any given positive integer $n$.
Fifteen further results that were discovered by computer experimentation are presented.
