Abstract: This work characterizes the vanishing of the Fourier coefficients of all CM eta-quotients. As consequences, we recover Serre's characterization about that of $\eta(12z)^{2}$ and recent results of Chang on the $p$-th coefficients of $\eta(4z)^{6}$ and $\eta(6z)^{4}$. Moreover, we generalize the results on the cases of weight~1 to the setting of binary quadratic forms.
