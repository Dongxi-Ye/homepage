Abstract: In this note, we construct canonical bases for the spaces of weakly holomorphic
modular forms with poles supported at the cusp $$\infty$$ for $$\Gamma_{0}(4)$$ of integral weight $$k$$ for
$$k \leq −1$$, and we make use of the basis elements for the case $$k = −1$$ to construct
explicit Borcherds products on unitary group $$U(2, 1)$$.
