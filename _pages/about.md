Hi there, welcome to my homepage. I am Dongxi Ye, an Associate Professor at the Sun Yat-sen University, a Ph.D. graduate of University of Wisconsin-Madison under the supervision of Prof. Tonghai Yang, and a BSc (First Class Honours) graduate of Massey University under the supervision of Prof. Shaun Cooper. My research specialty is number theory, and in particular topics that have connections to modular forms and Riemann surfaces. For example, $$\mathbb{Z}$$.
