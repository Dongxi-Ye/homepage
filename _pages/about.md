Hi there, welcome to my homepage. I am Dongxi Ye, an Associate Professor at Beijing Normal-Hong Kong Baptist University (BNBU), a Ph.D. graduate of University of Wisconsin-Madison under the supervision of Prof. Tonghai Yang, and a BSc (First Class Honours) graduate of Massey University under the supervision of Prof. Shaun Cooper. Before joining BNBU, I was an Associate Professor at Sun Yat-sen University for 2018-2025.

My research specialty is number theory and in particular, topics that have connection to modular form and Riemann surface. For example, it can be shown that the classical yet striking formula

$$
\frac{21}{8}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\binom{2n}{n}^{3}\left(n+\frac{5}{42}\right)\frac{1}{2^{12n}}=\frac{1}{\pi}
$$

of Ramanujan actually arises from CM values of modular functions defined in the compact Riemann surface $$\overline{\Gamma_{0}(4)\backslash\mathbb{H}}$$. If you are interested in this kind of topic, feel free to drop me a line. I would love to discuss with you.
