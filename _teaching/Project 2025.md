Project description
===

Denote by $$M_{k}(p,\chi)$$ the vector space over $$\mathbb{C}$$ spanned by the holomorphic modular forms of weight~$$k$$ and level~$$\Gamma_{0}(p)$$ with Dirichlet character~$$\chi$$. 
It is known by the Riemann--Roch Theorem that such a vector space is of finite dimension. Now for a given modular form

$$
f(\tau)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}q^{n},
$$

define an operator $$U_{p}$$ on $$f(\tau)$$ by

$$
U_{p}(f)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{pn}q^{n}.
$$
Such an operator actually defines a linear automorphism of $$M_{k}(p,\chi)$$. In this project, we explicitly formulate the determinant of $$U_{p}$$ in terms of the data $$(k,p,\chi)$$.
As an implication, we fully confirmed all the conjectures of the second author Tim Huber posed in 2014; for example, in one of the conjectures it was asserted that

$$
        |\det(U_{3})|=3^{w(d)},
        $$
        
        where
        
       $$
         w(d)=\begin{cases}
            \frac{(3d-1)(d+1)}{2} &\text{ if } 2\nmid d,\\
            \frac{6d^2+3d}{4} &\text{ if } d\equiv0\pmod{4},\\
            \frac{6d^2+3d-2}{4} &\text{ if } d\equiv2\pmod{4}.
        \end{cases}
        $$
