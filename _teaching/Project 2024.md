Project description
===
In this project, we studied and characterized the vanishing of the Fourier coefficients of CM eta quotients. For example, we proved that if $$a(n)$$ is defined by

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a(n)q^{n}=q\prod_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-q^{n})^{3}(1-q^{7n})^{3},
$$

then $$a(n)$$ vanishes, i.e., $$a(n)=0$$ if and only if $$n=p^{e_{p}}n_{0}$$ with $$\gcd(p,n_{0})=1$$, $$p\equiv 3,5,6\pmod{7}$$ and $$e_{p}$$ being odd.
