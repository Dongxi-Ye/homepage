Project description
===

In this project, we gave a general formulation for certain conjectures of Z.-H. Sun that relate representations by sums of triangular numbers to representations 
by sums of squares, and provided a computationally feasible kit to validate specified cases. For example, if one defines

$$T(a_{1},\ldots,a_{k};n)=\left|\left\{(x_{1},\ldots,x_{k})\in\mathbb{Z}^{k}\left|\,a_{1}\frac{x_{1}(x_1+1)}{2}+\cdots+a_{k}\frac{x_{k}(x_k+1)}{2}=n\right.\right\}\right|$$

and

$$S(a_{1},\ldots,a_{k};n)=\left|\left\{(x_{1},\ldots,x_{k})\in\mathbb{Z}^{k}\left|\,a_{1}x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+a_{k}x_{k}^{2}=n\right.\right\}\right|,$$

then upon our computations, 

$${T(1,2,3,10;n)=\frac{4}{3}S(1,2,3,10;2n+4)}$$

for any $$n\equiv1\pmod{4}$$.
